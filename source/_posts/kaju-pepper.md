### Phase 1: Preparations (1 hour before cooking)

2. Blend tomatoes into a smooth puree
3. Grind ginger, garlic, green chilies, and mint leaves into a fine paste

### Phase 3: Making the Masala

2. Add curry leaves and whole spices; sauté for 30-40 seconds
3. Add crushed peppercorns; sauté for 20 seconds to release oils
4. Add ginger-garlic-chili paste; sauté for 2 minutes until fragrant

13. Add remaining ghee and butter
14. Finish with a final sprinkle of crushed black pepper
15. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves
16. Rest for 5 minutes before serving

## Notes
- The dish should have a prominent peppery heat that builds with each bite
- Use freshly crushed/ground pepper for best flavor
- The three-pepper approach (crushed, black powder, white powder) creates depth
- Balance the pepper heat with the creamy cashew base
- Increase mint leaves to complement the pepper profile

## Serving Suggestions
- Best paired with butter naan, roti, parotta, or ghee rice
- Serve hot to experience the full pepper flavor
- Garnish with an extra sprinkle of crushed pepper if desired
- A side of raita can help balance the heat

## Tips for Best Results
1. Don't skip the soaking time for cashews
2. Cook onions until properly golden for best flavor
3. Use room temperature milk for blending
4. Grind the cashew paste as smooth as possible
5. Simmer on low heat for the final cooking stage
6. Allow the curry to rest before serving for flavors to develop
